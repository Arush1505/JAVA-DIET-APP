# JAVA-DIET-APP
Hey everyone , WE build this app for the hostlers who face difficulty to maintain a healthy diet while eating mess food.
we took all the menu of my college mess for each day  .
This app makes a customizable menu / diet plan for the user on the particular day with some sleek features.
We will talk about the features but first check the table creation architecture for the database . 

DATABASE -> mess 
Tables in mess -> meals , info

Refer to the Tables folder for the table creation quries.

 About some key features about this .

## ->  Personalized :
We  have  included options for normal routine people as well as gym rats and lazy people as we know working people need more protein than usual . 

## -> Veg/ Non-veg option :
The menu is generated for both veg as well as non - veg people.

## -> Excess amount highlighted :
We have Also highlighted if the amount of protein in a time exceed the required amount.

## -> Servings Included:
We have Calculated the approximate amount of curry in a serving and provided the Serving instead of simply displaying amount in grams.

## -> Automatic protein calculation :
Just enter your height and weight and you are good to go. Requirement will be calculated automatically based on these and your general activity routine.

## -> Enhanced UI :
While swing does not offer much UI improvements , But we have managed to get the UI as attractive as possible.
